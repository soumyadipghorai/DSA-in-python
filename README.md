# DSA in python : 

Here I will put solutions of the popular DSA questions in python 

I mostly follow some popular youtube channels to learn Data Structures and algorithms but most of them are in C++ or Java so I try to write the same logic or sometimes my own in python. 

* This might be helpful for python programmers or the future Data Scientists who spend most of their time in python...

## Here you will find contents from the following youtube channels :
